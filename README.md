# COVID-19-Classifier

## Introduction

COVID-19 is one of the most destructive pandemic humankind has ever faced. It has not only shaken the economy across the world but also made it an extremely difficult task for effective medical help to reach across remote regions. 
An extremely accurate and lightweight AI model could be a solution for this as it could aid the doctors and medical team especially in remote areas to detect COVID-19. 

Hence keeping this in mind, this project aims to create a **deep learning based COVID-19 CT-Scan images classifier**.

## Approach

All deep learning tasks have pipelines which look quite similar to the below one:
